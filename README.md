# Hospital Database Management System

This project is a small hospital database built to practice SQL and relational database design.  
It uses **synthetic data** and focuses on answering common operational and reporting questions in a healthcare setting.

## What This Project Does
The database models everyday hospital data such as patients, staff, rooms, medications, payments, and health records.  
It’s designed to support basic operational reporting and analysis using SQL.

## What I Built
- A relational database schema with primary and foreign keys
- Sample hospital data (fully synthetic)
- SQL queries to answer operational and financial questions
- Views to simplify reporting
- Transactions and triggers to help keep data consistent

## Example Questions This Can Answer
- Which patients have ongoing conditions?
- What are the total and average payment amounts?
- How are rooms and staff assigned to patients?
- Which instructions or medications have been completed?

## Tools Used
- SQL / MySQL
- Relational database design

## Files in This Repo
- `hospital-schema.sql` – database tables and relationships  
- `hospital-data.sql` – sample data  
- `hospital-query.sql` – queries, views, transactions, and triggers  

## Notes
All data in this project is synthetic and used only for learning purposes.
